            <p>Dungeons & Dragons (commonly abbreviated as D&D or DnD) is a fantasy tabletop role-playing game (RPG)
                originally designed by Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson. It was first published in 1974 by Tactical Studies
                Rules, Inc. (TSR). It has been published by Wizards of the Coast (now a subsidiary of Hasbro) since
                1997.</p>
            <p>The game was derived from miniature wargames, with a variation of the 1971 game Chainmail serving as the
                initial rule system. D&D's publication is commonly recognized as the beginning of modern role-playing
                games and the role-playing game industry</p>
            <p>D&D departs from traditional wargaming by allowing each player to create their own character to play
                instead of a military formation. These characters embark upon imaginary adventures within a fantasy
                setting. A Dungeon Master (DM) serves as the game's referee and storyteller, while maintaining the
                setting in which the adventures occur, and playing the role of the inhabitants of the game world. The
                characters form a party and they interact with the setting's inhabitants and each other. Together they
                solve dilemmas, engage in battles, explore, and gather treasure and knowledge. In the process, the
                characters earn experience points (XP) in order to rise in levels, and become increasingly powerful over
                a series of separate gaming sessions.</p>
